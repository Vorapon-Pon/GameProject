## About

This project is a Java-based game that demonstrates OOP principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction. The goal is to create an engaging, yet simple game that showcases how Java and OOP can work together to build interactive applications.

## Features

- **User Interface**: A simple, text-based or GUI interface (depending on your design) for ease of interaction.
- **Game Mechanics**: Core mechanics driven by OOP classes and methods.
- **OOP Principles**: Implementation of classes, objects, and inheritance hierarchies.
- **Java Standard Library Usage**: Utilizes Java libraries for game functionality.
